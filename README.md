Small go library for mocking parts of the [time package](https://golang.org/pkg/time/).

## Example

The package contains a `Clock` and `Ticker` interface which wrap the `time.Now`, `time.After`,
adnd `time.Sleep` functions and the `Ticker` struct, respectively.

A *real* clock can be created for general (non-test) use. This implementation simply falls back
to the functions provided in the time package.

```go
clock := glock.NewRealClock()
clock.Now()                       // calls time.Now
clock.After(time.Second)          // calls time.After(time.Second)

t := clock.NewTicker(time.Second) // wraps time.NewTicker(time.Second)
t.Chan()                          // returns ticker's C field
t.Stop()                          // stops the ticker
```

In order to make unit tests that depend on time deterministic (and free of sleep calls), a *mock*
clock can be used in place of the real clock. The mock clock allows you to control the current
time with `SetCurrent` and `Advance` methods.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()

clock.Now() // returns time of creation
clock.Now() // returns time of creation
clock.SetCurrent(time.Unix(603288000, 0))
clock.Now() // returns Feb 12, 1989
clock.Advance(time.Day)
clock.Now() // returns Feb 13, 1989
```

The `Advance` method will also trigger a value on the channels created by the `After` and
`Ticker` functions.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClockAt(time.Unix(603288000, 0))

c1 := clock.After(time.Second)
c2 := clock.After(time.Minute)
clock.GetAfterArgs()            // returns {time.Second, time.Minute}
clock.GetAfterArgs()            // returns {}
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires c2
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires c1
```

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()
ticker := clock.NewTicker(time.Minute)

ch := ticker.Chan()
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30)
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires ch
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30)
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires ch
```
